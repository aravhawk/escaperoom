      <h1 class="btn-warning">Here's clue / riddle 4</h1>
      <h3 class="btn-info">One brother says of his younger brother: “Two years ago, I was three times as old as my brother was. In three years’ time, I will be twice as old as my brother.” How old are they each now? (You might be confused on how to enter this. For example, if the older brother is 8 and the younger brother is 3, the answer to this riddle will be written as 83.)</h3>
